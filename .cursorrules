# Cursor Rules for Meditation App Development

## 🏗️ Architectural Patterns

### Project Structure
- Follow the existing Expo Router structure with `app/` directory
- Keep components in `components/` directory
- Store types in `types/` directory
- Place utilities in `utils/` directory
- Store data and constants in `data/` directory
- Keep hooks in `hooks/` directory

### File Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component files: `BreathingAnimation.tsx`
- Use camelCase for utility files: `breathingTimer.ts`
- Use kebab-case for data files: `preset-routines.ts`
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose

### Component Architecture
- Prefer functional components with hooks over class components
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props and state
- Implement proper error boundaries for critical components
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

## 📝 Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Avoid `any` type - use proper typing
- Use union types for finite sets of values
- Implement proper error handling with typed errors

### React/React Native
- Use React hooks for state management
- Implement proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Use React.memo for performance optimization when needed
- Follow React Native best practices for performance
- Use proper navigation patterns with Expo Router

### State Management
- Use React Context for global state
- Prefer local state with useState for component-specific state
- Use useReducer for complex state logic
- Implement proper state persistence with AsyncStorage
- Handle loading and error states consistently

## 🎬 Animation & Transition Standards

### Screen Transitions
- **Stack Navigation**: Use `slide_from_right` animation for all stack navigation (300ms duration)
- **Modal Presentations**: Use `slide_from_bottom` animation for auth screens (400ms duration)
- **Tab Navigation**: Ensure smooth transitions between tabs with consistent timing
- **Error Screens**: Use `fade` animation for not-found screens (200ms duration)
- **Gesture Navigation**: Enable horizontal swipe-to-go-back functionality
- **Consistent Timing**: All animations follow established duration standards
- **Route-Specific**: Configure animations in `app/_layout.tsx` for different screen types

### Animation Implementation
- **Root Layout**: Centralize animation configuration in `app/_layout.tsx`
- **Route-Specific**: Use custom animations for different screen types (auth, tabs, errors)
- **Gesture Support**: Enable horizontal gesture navigation across all routes
- **Platform Consistency**: Ensure animations work seamlessly on both iOS and Android
- **Performance Optimized**: Use native driver for smooth 60fps animations
- **Animation Types**: 
  - Main routes: `slide_from_right` (300ms)
  - Auth screens: `slide_from_bottom` (400ms)
  - Error screens: `fade` (200ms)

### Performance Guidelines
- Always use `useNativeDriver: true` when possible
- Keep animation durations between 200-600ms for optimal UX
- Avoid complex animations during critical user flows
- Test animations on both iOS and Android devices
- Monitor animation performance in development
- Use consistent animation patterns across the app

## 🎨 UI/UX Guidelines

### Design System
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Implement proper color contrast ratios

### 3D Effects & Shadows
- Apply elevation: 20 for major cards and buttons
- Use shadowColor: '#000000' for consistent shadows
- Implement shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 15 } for depth
- Apply shadowOpacity: 0.4 for visible but subtle shadows
- Use shadowRadius: 20 for soft, natural shadow edges
- Add backgroundColor: '#f8fafc' to wrapper containers for shadow visibility

### Color Coding System
- **Beginner routines**: Soft blue gradient (#3b82f6 → #60a5fa → #93c5fd)
- **Energy routines**: Vibrant orange gradient (#ea580c → #f97316 → #fb923c)
- **Calm routines**: Soothing purple gradient (#7c3aed → #8b5cf6 → #a78bfa)
- **Advanced routines**: Intense red gradient (#dc2626 → #ef4444 → #f87171)
- **Custom routines**: Default blue gradient (#1e3a8a → #1e40af → #3b82f6)

### Text Contrast & Readability
- Use white text (`color: 'white'`) on all gradient backgrounds
- Apply semi-transparent white (`rgba(255,255,255,0.9)`) for secondary text
- Ensure all text has sufficient contrast against backgrounds
- Use consistent font weights and sizes across similar elements
- Test text readability on different screen sizes and brightness levels

### Accessibility
- Implement proper accessibility labels
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide keyboard navigation support
- Test with screen readers
- Follow WCAG guidelines

### Animation Guidelines
- Use React Native Animated API for screen transitions

## 📊 Data Persistence & Profile Management

### AsyncStorage Patterns
- Use consistent key naming: `userProfile`, `customRoutines`, etc.
- Implement proper error handling for storage operations
- Validate data before saving to storage
- Use TypeScript interfaces for stored data structures
- Handle storage failures gracefully with user feedback

### Profile Data Structure
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  firstName: string;

  profilePicture?: string;
}
```

### Data Synchronization
