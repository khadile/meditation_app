## 🔄 Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Planning & Requirements
```
1. Reference PRD for product vision and goals
2. Identify feature gaps or improvements needed
3. Create RFC for new feature/change
4. Review with stakeholders using PRD as context
5. Get approval and move to implementation
```

### Phase 2: Development
```
1. Follow Cursor Rules for coding standards
2. Reference Features Documentation for existing patterns
3. Implement according to RFC specifications
4. Update Features Documentation as needed
5. Maintain code quality through regular reviews
```

### Phase 3: Testing & Deployment
```
1. Test against RFC success criteria
2. Validate against PRD user experience goals
3. Ensure compliance with Cursor Rules
4. Update documentation with lessons learned
5. Deploy and monitor success metrics
```

## 🎯 How Documents Work Together

### Document Relationships
```
PRD (Vision & Goals)
    ↓
RFCs (Specific Changes)
    ↓
Cursor Rules (Implementation Standards)
    ↓
Features Documentation (Current State)
    ↓
Updated PRD (Lessons Learned)
```

### Decision Flow
1. **PRD** defines what we want to achieve
2. **RFC** proposes how to achieve it
3. **Cursor Rules** ensure quality implementation
4. **Features Documentation** tracks what we've built
5. **Updated PRD** incorporates learnings
