## üìö Quick Start

### For New Team Members
1. **Start Here**: [Workflow Overview](workflow-overview.md) - How everything works together
2. **Product Vision**: [PRD](PRD.md) - What we're building and why
3. **Development Standards**: [Cursor Rules](../.cursorrules) - How to write code
4. **Current Features**: [Features Documentation](features.md) - What's already built

### For Feature Development
1. **Check PRD**: Ensure alignment with product goals
2. **Review Features**: Understand existing patterns
3. **Create RFC**: Use [RFC Template](RFC-template.md) for new features
4. **Follow Standards**: Use Cursor Rules during implementation

- **What**: Product vision, goals, user personas, success metrics
- **When**: Project planning, stakeholder alignment, feature prioritization
- **Who**: Product managers, stakeholders, entire team

### Cursor Rules - Ground Rules
- **What**: Coding standards, architectural patterns, anti-patterns
- **When**: Every development session, code reviews, onboarding
- **Who**: Developers, technical leads, code reviewers

### Features Documentation - Current State
- **What**: Complete feature inventory, implementation details, user flows
- **When**: Feature development, bug fixes, user support, testing
- **Who**: Developers, designers, QA, support team

### RFCs - Incremental Development
- **What**: Specific feature proposals, implementation plans, risk assessment
- **When**: New features, major changes, performance improvements
- **Who**: Developers, technical leads, product managers

## üîß Quick Reference

### Common Tasks

#### Starting a New Feature
1. Check [PRD](PRD.md) for alignment
2. Review [Features Documentation](features.md) for patterns
3. Create RFC using [RFC Template](RFC-template.md)
4. Get stakeholder approval
5. Implement following [Cursor Rules](../.cursorrules)

#### Fixing a Bug
1. Reference [Features Documentation](features.md) for expected behavior
2. Follow [Cursor Rules](../.cursorrules) for code quality
3. Update documentation if behavior changes
4. Create RFC if fix introduces new patterns

#### Onboarding New Team Member
1. Read [Workflow Overview](workflow-overview.md)
2. Study [PRD](PRD.md) for product understanding
3. Review [Cursor Rules](../.cursorrules) for standards
4. Browse [Features Documentation](features.md) for current state
5. Practice with small features

#### Code Review
1. Check compliance with [Cursor Rules](../.cursorrules)
2. Verify alignment with [Features Documentation](features.md)
